message=To all UNSW guys.....just a little tip for ya'll...if you want to talk to a girl but are scared you'll look like an idiot, chances are she's thinking the same thing about herself so just APPROACH HER! I promise you she will love that you did it! And just think..youll probably never see her again if you don't approach her so man up boys!\nWritten on behalf of all UNSW ladies ;)
