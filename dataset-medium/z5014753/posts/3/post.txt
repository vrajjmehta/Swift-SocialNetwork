message=Dear Ray Chan\n\nAs soon as I saw your NMDs, beige Ralph Lauren cap and fear of god knockoff h&m pants, I knew you were the one for me. Such swag, many wow. Honestly hoping and praying you don't have a gf, those guns poking under your h&m dress shirt are hard to miss <3 I know a person who can get you cheap protein, lemme know if you need it yeah? ;)\n\nFrom your secret admirer
