message=To the Fifth Year Vision science student, I actually think i am in love with you. I have grown a really interesting feeling towards you and feel like we should move on to the next stage but I am not a typical guy who would confess to anyone. I haven't being in a relationship for such a long time that I no longer have the guts to confess to a girl. Please pay close attention to close guy friends around you so that you can pick it up that I like you and maybe show a sign that you are interested in a relationship with me, this would give me the guts to confess to you!
