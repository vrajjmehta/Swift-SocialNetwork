message=To my Computing 1 tutor... You can compile my code anytime. My 'up-time' is better than BSD. You had me at "Hello World." You've stolen the ASCII to my heart. I'd switch to emacs for you. Come to my 127.0.0.1 and Iâ€™ll give you sudo access. I must be using Apple maps, because I keep getting lost in your eyes.
